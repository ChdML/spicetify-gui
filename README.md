## GUI App made for [Spicetify](https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-cli) with [Tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri)
Install, update, upgrade, and do other things to spicetify with only a click of a button\
\
\
*Note: Tested on windows only, but should work on linux/mac*\
*Another note: I made this app so i can experiment with tauri and learn it, I'll probably rarely update the code unless there's bugs.*
